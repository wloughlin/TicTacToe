A variation of tic-tac-to that combines Ultimate tic-tac-toe with Quantum tic-tac-toe.

On a turn may play a move in both of the sub-boards determined by their opponents last move. If the opponent played a move in the top-right and center boxes of their sub-boards, you may play a move in the top-right and center sub-boards.

After making both of your moves, the boxes you choose will be connected in an internal graph where each pair of moves represents an edge. When a player's move causes a cycle in this graph, their opponent chooses how to collapse the cycle by dragging one of their moves to its partner, collapsing it into the box.

The object is to win 3 sub-boards in a row, column, or diagonal.
